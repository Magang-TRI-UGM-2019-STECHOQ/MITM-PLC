# Before run Festo Field
## PART 1
Before Festo Field being opened, there are a weird HTTP request 

__PC:54515 to 239.255.255.250:1900__
```
GET /cgi-bin/cpx-diag-json?_=1627903003872 HTTP/1.1

{
    "data": [

        [
            "0",
            "diag-ok",
            "OK"
        ],
        [
            "0",
            "diag-ok",
            "OK"
        ],
        [
            "0",
            "diag-ok",
            "OK"
        ],
        [
            "0",
            "diag-ok",
            "OK"
        ]
    ]
}
```

At this point,  
I still not open Codesys or Festo Field yet.  

There is possibility that those data   
was triggered by background services  
to check PLC connection.
  
## PART 2
After that I found some transactions (UDP).  
Perhaps it's being used to say that "Hey, I'm active".  
Let's call them as "Ping" transaction

Yups, it's clearly a "Ping" to check availability ports on each devices  

We'll need them later to clean some mixed packets.

## PART 3
I found some SSDP Packet that contains,
```
M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1
Host: 239.255.255.250:1900
ST: urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice:1
Man: "ssdp:discover"
MX: 3
```

If you search about SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol), SSDP is a protocol to discovery network services. 

In my opinion, it seems this packet is not related with Festo Field or PLC.
