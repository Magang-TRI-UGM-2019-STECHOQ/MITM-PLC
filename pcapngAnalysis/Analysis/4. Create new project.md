## PART 1
Some UDP packet appear.  

__PC:10002 to 239.255.2.3:10002__
```
IN RAW : (x88) 00
```

Is is have any relation with "235.255.2.3:10002"  
within ```2. First run Festo Field``` ?  
But apparently if data contains "00",  
it seems they are not important.

## PART 2
There are another "Ping".  
They are similar to the "Ping" in ```1. Before Festo Field```
