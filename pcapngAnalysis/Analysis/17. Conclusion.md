# Conclusion
After I read whole pcapng,  
there are only some important files :  

1. Before Festo Field
2. First run Festo,  
7. Add device inside gateway,  
10. Scan network in Codesys,  
13. Online,  
14. Logout,  
15. Download when online,  
16. Download only  

## Grouping
We can group them by their function as below,  
- Acknowledgement  
  1. Before Festo Field,  
  2. First run Festo,  
  7. Add device inside gateway,  
  10. Scan network in Codesys,  

- Download  
  13. Online,  
  14. Logout,  
  15. Download when online,  
  16. Download only  

## Detailing
Some facts that I notice is :  
1. Mostly packets is transported by UDP

2. "Ping" that I found at ```1. Before Festo Field``` is always executed every several seconds. They sent  PC:1743 to 192.168.91.255:1740~1743  
PLC:1740 to 192.168.91.255:1740~1743  
It is make one question:  
When is the first "Ping" being sent ?

3. In ```2. First run Festo```, we know that  
to acknowledge PLC, Festo Field use :  
    - Multicast (235.xxx.xxx.xxx, 239.xxx.xxx.xxx)
    - Broadcast (255.255.255.255)  

4. In ```2. First run Festo```, we could write the acknowledge process as below : 
    - PC sent message to start scan (via multicast)
        - PC:51042 to 239.255.255.1:3900
    - PC confirm that PC is active (via multicast)
        - PC:10002 to 235.255.2.3:10002
    - PLC confirm that PLC is active (via multicast)
        - PLC:10002 to 235.255.2.3:10002
    - PC sent message to start scan (via broadcast)
        - PC:51044 to 255.255.255.255:990
    - PLC confirm that PLC is active (via broadcast)
        - PLC:990 to 255.255.255.255:990
    - PLC stop broadcast (via multicast)
        - PC:51046 to 239.255.255.1:3900
    - PC directly check PLC version
        - PC:51048 <-> PLC:10002
    - PC connected to PLC
        - PC:51059 <-> PLC:991

5. In ```7. Add device inside gateway```,  
it is the first time, PC sent message to PLC via TCP.

6. In ```10. Scan network in Codesys```,  
PC:1743 sent message similar to "Ping" to 192.168.91.255:1740~1743, and after that PLC directly sent its version to PC.  
It's make me wonder,  
Is Codesys only could handle 4 PLC at one time ?

7. In ```13. Online```, ```15. Download when online```, ```16. Download only ```, before they sent file/program to PLC, they'll check if related PLC still connected.

8. Either application or boot file, they have header and footer

There are still one thing left to do, that is "Testing"
