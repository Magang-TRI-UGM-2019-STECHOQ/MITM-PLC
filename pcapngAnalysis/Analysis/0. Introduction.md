To search patterns, we need to think about all possibilities.  
We can't just say like :  
- There is no way we could read it
- I believe that all data is being encrypted
- There is no meaning within these data
- That part is not related with our topic

Sure, we could said them   
but after we include them to our possibilities  
and verify those possibilities.  

That is where I began my journey,  
to search all of those possibilities  
and to reach a conclusion.
